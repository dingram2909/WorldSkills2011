<p class="under">Pancakes</p><br/>

<p class="centund">Ingredients</p><br/>

    <p>125g plain flour</p>
    <p>Pinch of salt</p>
    <p>1 large egg</p>
    <p>300ml (1/2 pint) semi-skimmed milk</p>
    <p>2tsp vegetable oil</p>
    <p>1 lemon, sliced into quarters</p>
    <p>2tsp sugar</p><br/>

<p class="centund">Method</p><br/>

    <p>Put the flour, salt, egg and milk into a large mixing bowl with 2tbsp of cold water. Using a hand whisk or a hand-held electric mixer, whisk the ingredients together to make a thin batter.</p><br/>
    <p>Heat a small heavy-based non-stick frying pan and add 2-3 drops of oil for each pancake you make. Spoon in about 3tblsp of batter, tilting the pan as the batter is added to swirl it over the base.</p><br/>
    <p>When the underside of the pancake is cooked, flip it over to cook the other side. Cook 8 thin pancakes in this way and serve them as soon as they're cooked or keep them warm in a low oven until all 8 are ready.</p><br/>
    <p>Serve 2 pancakes to each person with a lemon quarter for squeezing and half a tspn of sugar.</p><br/>
