<p class="under">Football</p><br/>

<p>It's one of the nation's favourite participation and spectator sports, but football is just one of many examples of team ball sports that are accessible to players of all standards.</p><br/>

<p>Almost all towns and villages in the UK have football clubs that operate at varying levels, from social to professional. In addition, leagues are set up for the full game and five-a-side, and are organised through sports and social clubs, health clubs, sports centres, schools and even pubs.</p><br/>

<p class="center"><img src="images/football1.jpg" alt="Football" /></p><br/>

<p>Football is a multiple sprint sport requiring players to spend some of their time sprinting and other times running fast or slowly, walking or even standing still.</p><br/>

<p>Varying degrees of fitness are required, depending on the player's position in the team, the amount of time spent on the field and the level at which the game is played, but a full 90-minute match, for example, demands high levels of aerobic fitness. </p><br/>
