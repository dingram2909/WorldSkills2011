<p class="under">Keeping fit</p><br/>

<p>You don't have to slog it out in a sweaty gym to maintain your fitness. Simply boosting your levels of general daily activity can massively improve your health and energy.</p><br/>

<p class="under">Importance of exercise - what are the physical and social benefits?</p><br/>

<p>The pressures of home and family life can also mean it feels as if there's little time left to fit in exercise. It's certainly tough to get started.</p><br/>

<p>So, it's worth thinking about what you gain from regular exercise and making even a partial improvement to your fitness.</p><br/>

<p>Physical inactivity is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease - in other words, if you don't exercise you dramatically increase your risk of dying from a heart attack.</p><br/>

<p>Conversely, exercise means a healthier heart because it reduces several cardiovascular risks, including high blood pressure.</p><br/>

<p>Being physically active can bolster good mental health and help you to manage stress, anxiety and even depression.</p><br/>

<p>Regular exercise as you age keeps you strong, mobile and less dependent on others.</p><br/>

<p>Regular exercise can help you achieve and maintain an ideal weight, which can be important in managing many health conditions, or may just make you feel happier about your appearance.</p><br/>

<p>All exercise helps strengthen bones and muscles to some degree, but weight-bearing exercise, such as running, is especially good in promoting bone density and protecting against osteoporosis, which affects men as well as women.</p><br/>

<p>Different exercises help with all sorts of health niggles, such as digestion, poor posture and sleeplessness, and physical activity can be beneficial for a range of medical conditions, from diabetes to lower back pain.</p><br/>

<p>Take a look at some of the links on the side to see what we would recommend.</p>
