Ingredients

    125g plain flour
    Pinch of salt
    1 large egg
    300ml (1/2 pint) semi-skimmed milk
    2tsp vegetable oil
    1 lemon, sliced into quarters
    2tsp sugar

Method

    Put the flour, salt, egg and milk into a large mixing bowl with 2tbsp of cold water. Using a hand whisk or a hand-held electric mixer, whisk the ingredients together to make a thin batter.
    Heat a small heavy-based non-stick frying pan and add 2-3 drops of oil for each pancake you make. Spoon in about 3tblsp of batter, tilting the pan as the batter is added to swirl it over the base.
    When the underside of the pancake is cooked, flip it over to cook the other side. Cook 8 thin pancakes in this way and serve them as soon as they're cooked or keep them warm in a low oven until all 8 are ready.
    Serve 2 pancakes to each person with a lemon quarter for squeezing and half a tspn of sugar.
