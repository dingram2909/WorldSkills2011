<br/><br/>
<p>As part of a healthy lifestyle you should regularly challenge yourself. How can you do this? Try these ideas.</p><br/>

<p>Active Challenge: Take the stairs whenever you can today, avoiding all escalators, elevators, moving walkways, etc. all day.</p><br/>

<p>Exercise Challenge: Do at least 30 minutes of cardio exercise and push yourself to go faster, higher or harder for at least one minute, 3 times during your workout.</p><br/>

<p class="center"><img src="images/tennis.jpg" alt="A tennis image." /></p><br/>

<p>Flexibility Challenge: Do the exercises in this Yoga Workout after your cardio workout and at least one more time during the day.</p><br/>

<p>Nutrition Challenge: After one meal today, take 5-10 minutes to write in a journal recording what you ate, how much you ate and how you felt after eating (too full? satisfied? still hungry?). Now, come up with at least one idea for how you could improve that meal. For example:</p><br/>

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&raquo;Use smaller plates or bowls to help you control your portions.<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&raquo;Make your meals more balanced so you're getting more variety.<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&raquo;Reduce your fat intake so you feel more energetic after eating.<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&raquo;Make sure you get enough protein so you feel satisfied.<br/><br/>

<p>If these challenges don't work, feel free to create your own and post your experiences here. How did you challenge yourself today and did it help you be more active? Do you like having something to work for?</p><br/>
