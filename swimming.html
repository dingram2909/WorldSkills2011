<p>Swimming is another popular way to start getting fit because most towns have a pool, it's still relatively inexpensive and you need even less kit than you do for running.</p><br/>

<p>Most pools also offer lessons if you're a non-swimmer, or you haven't swum for years and want to improve your technique.</p><br/>

<p>Swimming is a great way to tone up and trim down, because to swim you need to move your body against the resistance of the water. Just swimming a few lengths involves most of the major muscle groups, giving your body a good workout. And if you crank up the pace, you'll get a brilliant aerobic workout, too.</p><br/>

<p>Swimming is also an effective form of fat-burning exercise: because you can swim at your own pace, slowly if you wish, you can keep swimming for long periods, and maintaining your staying power is a vital goal in fat-burning exercise.</p><br/>

<p>The other big advantage is that water supports your weight and takes the stress off your joints, so you can put your body through a good workout without your knees, hips or spine paying the price.</p><br/>

<p>Research shows that exercising in waist-deep water reduces the pressure on joints by 50 per cent, while exercising in chest-deep water reduces it by as much as 75 per cent. This can also make it a great exercise if you're recovering from an injury that means you can't run or play your normal sport.</p><br/>

<p>However, while this is great if you have joint problems such as arthritis, it won't build up much protection against the brittle bone disease osteoporosis because it's not a weight-bearing exercise, so you make want to alternate swimming with other activities. </p><br/>
